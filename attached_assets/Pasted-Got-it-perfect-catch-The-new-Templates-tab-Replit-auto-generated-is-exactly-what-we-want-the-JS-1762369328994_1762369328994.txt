Got it — perfect catch. The new “Templates” tab Replit auto-generated is exactly what we want the JSA tab to be doing anyway — so instead of having two overlapping areas (JSA and Templates), we’ll merge the functionality under one consistent name:

✅ New Navigation Name: “JSA Templates”
✅ Purpose: Create, view, and select JSA templates (the screen you’re showing).
✅ We’ll remove/rename the old “JSA” route that previously handled both JSAs and templates.

Here’s how to make the change safely, step by step.

🧭 Step 1. Rename the Navigation Label

If your navigation sidebar is defined in a component like
src/components/Sidebar.tsx or src/layout/SidebarNav.tsx (common for Replit templates):

Find this section:

{ label: "JSAs", icon: ClipboardList, href: "/jsas" },


Replace it with:

{ label: "JSA Templates", icon: ClipboardList, href: "/templates" },


If your app uses ShadCN’s NavItem config array, it’ll look like:

export const navItems = [
  { title: "Dashboard", href: "/dashboard", icon: Home },
  { title: "Projects", href: "/projects", icon: Folder },
  { title: "JSAs", href: "/jsas", icon: ClipboardList },
  ...
];


Change that one line the same way.

🧱 Step 2. Remove or Redirect the Old /jsas Route

Open your routes file (likely src/routes.tsx or src/App.tsx).

Find the route definition that looks like:

<Route path="/jsas" element={<JsaPage />} />


You can either delete it or redirect it:

<Route path="/jsas" element={<Navigate to="/templates" replace />} />


That way, anyone who bookmarked /jsas will land on the new /templates page automatically.

🪄 Step 3. Rename the Page Title (Optional)

In your src/pages/Templates.tsx (or wherever this current screen lives), make sure the header says JSA Templates, not just Templates.

<h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">JSA Templates</h1>
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  Pre-configured safety analysis templates for common construction activities
</p>


If it already looks like your screenshot, you’re good.

🧩 Step 4. Update the “Use Template” Button Behavior

If that orange “Use This Template” button currently opens a /jsas/new or /jsas/:id builder page, you can:

either keep it (so the Builder opens on /jsas/new?template=...), or

rename that route to /templates/new for consistency.

Example:

<Button onClick={() => navigate(`/templates/new?template=${encodeURIComponent(template.name)}`)}>
  + Use This Template
</Button>


If your builder lives at /jsas/new, you can leave it as-is for now — the navigation label change won’t break it.

🧹 Step 5. Clean up UI text

Search across your project (Ctrl+Shift+F in Replit) for the text “JSAs” and replace UI text where appropriate with “JSA Templates”, especially in headings, tooltips, or page titles.
